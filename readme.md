[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/csukuangfj/ppm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/csukuangfj/ppm)


## Introduction

This repository contains the source code for my thesis,
which implements and extends [CPM][1] for motion estimation
and [PatchMatch Stereo][2] for stereo matching.

You can obtain a copy of the thesis at the address: https://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/handle/11682/9592

The estimation results
for the standard benchmarks are available
at: [KITTI-2012][8], [KITTI-2015][9],
[MPI Sintel][10] and [Middlebury][11].

## Usage

It has been tested on macOS and Ubuntu.

To compile the code, you need to install [OpenCV][3]
and its contribution module [opencv_contrib][4].
In addition, your compiler has to support C++11.

1. Download the repository.

2. Build the code

```.sh
cd ppm
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
```

3. It will generate three demo executables
 - `ppm_cmd` for CPM without post processing (motion estimation)
 - `ppm_cmd_with_epic` for CPM with post processing (motion estimation)
 - `ppm_st_cmd` for stereo matching.

Refer to [ppm_commandline.cpp][5],
[ppm_commandline_with_epic_flow.cpp][6]
and [ppm_st_cmd.cpp][7] for how to use it.
